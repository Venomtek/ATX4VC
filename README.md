ATX4VC: ATX Power on retro computers!

ATX4VC is a controller for adapting ATX power supplies to vintage computers.

Power supplies are a major failure point of retro computers today. Those early PSUs are often heavy, inefficient, runs hot, and after 40 odd years, many are not working, or worse might casuse damage with out-of-spec voltages.

Oh and did i mention they often literally blow up?

ATX4VC is designed to replace them with much more reliable modern ATX power supplies, and as a tool to help test and diagnose vintage computers.

ATX4VC breaks out all the common voltages (12V, 5V, 3.3V, -5V, -12V), and include many convienct features such as power button and LED header, 4-

pin fan headers with PWM speed control, ARGB headers, temperature probe fan curve, and fused outputs.

# Quick start guide

If your havent assembled your ATX4VC, head here.

Make sure the jumper is in "soft power" setting, and Plug the 20 or 24 pin ATX motherboard header. The "5VSB' LED should light up, showing the PSU is ready to go.

Press the power button, the PSU should turn on and LED on all voltage rails should light up. 

that's the gist of it! but please do keep reading for the complete info.

## Power connections

## power button

you can use the built-in power button, or connect an additional button to the header

## power LED

make sure the plority

## Fan headers

## ARGB control

## Additional connections

your can attach an external power button and power LED using the headers shown below.

BOTH momentary buttons and flip-switchs are supported.

To connect power cable, Loosen the screw terminal. insert the cable, and tighten again to secure it. Don't leave exposed conductors to prevent shorts.

Your can plug in two standard 12V PC fans and two ARGB light sources into the headers below.

Your can adjust the RGB colour, animation, brightness, and fan speed using the buttons below. Your can also attach external buttons to the headers. 

HOLD down the button to cycle through RGB colour faster.

The settings should be presistent.

### fuse and current rating

ATX4VC uses standard car fuses, medium, small, and low-profile all work, just push it into the header.

Modern PSUs should have plenty currenty capaacity for retro systems. you should still check to make sure.

+12V, +5V, and +3.3V are fused, Make sure the TOTAL CURRENT ACROSS ALL RAILS THROUGH ATX4VC is less than 5 amps. If more is needed, tap the power seperately from a molex connector.

Negative rails are not fused because they are low-

current (around 200mA), and built-in protection is adaquate.

### recommended power0 supplies

a regular ATX power supply always work, but i really like those Pico ATX PSUs as well, they are tiny and plugs directly into the connector, making the whole package very compact. 

## mounting options and dimension

ATX4VC is designed to fit into a 2.5inch PC drive bay, and is compact enough to fit in many vintage computers. use M3 screws and nuts. dimension drawing below. 

## jumper settings and header pinouts

ATX4VC uses soft power by default, which uses a pushbutton to turn it on or off. you can switch to hard power by moving the jumper to the left, which turns on the PSU as soon as it is plugged in.

## Safety precautions (again)

* Double check you're using the correct voltage rail!

* don't leave conducters exposed at the terminal block to prevent shorting out.

* Don't bypass the fuse, and keep total current THROUGH ATX4VC below 5 amps.
