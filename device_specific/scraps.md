## Repair Notes

If your Mac is not working, this adaptor eliminates the PSU from the equation, but that's only part of the puzzle!

Other common issues include:

* Cracked solder joints

* Shorted tantalum capacitors

* Dirty contacts / Bad RAMs

I strongly recommend watching [Adrian's Digital Basement Macintosh Repair-a-thon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKD65I86XGQ), where he covers a lot of those issues in detail.

### Parts

Note the name of all the parts:

### Assembly

Note the name of all the parts:


Insert the **3.96mm 11-Pin Female Header** on the BOTTOM side:

Hold it in place with masking tape or sticky putty. Flip it over, solder **a single pin** first, then make sure the component is **straight in all directions**.

If not, you can adjust it while melting that single pin. Once happy, solder the rest of the pins. **This applies to all components in this kit.**

Now you can do the same with the rest of the parts on the TOP side. 

I would suggest starting from shortest component to tallest. That would be fuse holder -> 0.1 inch headers -> terminal block -> fan header -> ATX connector -> 11-pin power connector.

Observe the notes:

fuse holder metal part all the way into plastic base.
