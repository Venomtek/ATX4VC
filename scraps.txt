### recommended power0 supplies

a regular ATX power supply always work, but i really like those Pico ATX PSUs as well, they are tiny and plugs directly into the connector, making the whole package very compact. 


## Safety precautions (again)

* Double check you're using the correct voltage rail!

I actually took it to a coffee shop and wrote most of this there! Talk about hipsters and laptops right?
